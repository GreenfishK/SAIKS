1. if we leave out the Domains field for a data property the pitfall scanner OOPS will scream. 
   But we have a property "hasName" multiple times in our ontology. We cannot define 
   all of them as Domains as the domains are intersected. How do we solve that?
2. can we replace hasName by rdfs:label?
   Person hasName
   Association hasName
   Bookmaker hasName
   Sponsor hasName
   Competition hasName
   Division hasName
   Nation hasName
   Role hasName
   Round hasName
   Season hasName
3. Do Entities which have only one property, e.g. hasName make sense?
